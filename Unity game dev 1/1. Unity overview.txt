1. When we open Unity we see the default layout, it can be customized and saved by shifting the panels via drag and drop and then saving them in a custom layouts.

2. The window has 6 main panels:

	Hierarchy:
	The Hierarchy shows all the objects currently present in our scene, which by default contains a "Camera object" & a "Light Source"
	
	Scene:
	Scene View shows you objects and allows you to observe as you change the object and properties that too with different possible views
	
	Game:
	Shows the preview of our game as viewed by the "Camera object"
	
	Inspector:
	Shows information about the selected object and provides a UI to change it's properties	
	
	Project:
	It contains assets for our project like scripts, audio file, 3D models etc. 

	Console:
	It helps print information from scripts for easy and bug fixes.

We can create multiple scenes by saving the current scene and opening a new one. These scenes will be present in the project window and can be viewed anytime by just a click.
